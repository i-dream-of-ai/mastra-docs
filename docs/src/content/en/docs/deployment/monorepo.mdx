# Monorepo Deployment

Deploying Mastra in a monorepo follows the same approach as deploying a standalone application. While some [Cloud](./cloud-providers/index.mdx) or [Serverless](./serverless-platforms/index.mdx) providers may introduce extra requirements, the core setup is the same.

## Example pnpm monorepo

In this example, the Mastra application is located at `apps/api`, which serves as the project root.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="api" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name=".mastra" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name=".build" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="output" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.Folder name="agents" />
          <FileTree.Folder name="tools" />
          <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" />
          <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="web" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="ui" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="utils" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="pnpm-workspace.yaml" />
</FileTree>

## Environment variables

Environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY` should be stored in an `.env` file at the package root of the Mastra application `(apps/api)`, for example:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="api" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".env" />
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Build and dev configuration

In a monorepo setup, all dependency packages used by Mastra must be built when the application is deployed. The root-level `build` script runs build commands for each workspace in the monorepo.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "pnpm -r --parallel --filter api --filter web dev",
    "build": "pnpm --filter ui build && pnpm --filter utils build && pnpm --filter web build && pnpm --filter api build"
  }
}
```

In a monorepo with both a Mastra application and a frontend, it's useful to define a root-level `dev` script that runs both services together. To run only the Mastra application, use a filtered command:

```bash copy
pnpm --filter api dev
```

## Compiler configuration (optional / advanced)

Mastra supports both **CommonJS (CJS)** and **ECMAScript Modules (ESM)**, making it compatible with a variety of JavaScript environments. In a monorepo setup, you can choose the module system that best fits your project.

### Module Support

Mastra provides dual builds for each module type:

- **ESM** builds use `.js` or `.mjs` extensions
- **CJS** builds use `.cjs` extensions

This ensures Mastra can integrate into projects using either module format.

### Build Output

When building Mastra in a monorepo, the build system (such as `tsc`, `esbuild`, or `Rollup`) should produce output that matches the selected module format. This ensures optimized builds for both ESM and CJS, maintaining compatibility with modern and legacy environments.

- **ESM** for projects using `import`/`export` syntax
- **CJS** for environments that use `require`/`module.exports`

### Advanced configuration

In your build pipeline, configure TypeScript to emit the correct module format. Here's an example `tsconfig.json` for ESM output in a monorepo setup:

```json filename="packages/utils/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "allowJs": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```
> To target CommonJS, change to: `module: "CommonJS"`.

## Deployment configuration

The example below shows how to select `apps/api` as the project root when deploying to [Mastra Cloud](../mastra-cloud/overview.mdx). While the interface may differ between providers, the configuration remains the same.

## Dependency management

In a monorepo, keep dependencies consistent to avoid version conflicts and build errors.

- Use a **single lockfile** at the project root so all packages resolve the same versions.
- Reference internal packages with the **workspace protocol (`workspace:*`)** instead of version numbers.
- Put **runtime code in `dependencies`** and keep tooling in `devDependencies`.
- Align versions of shared libraries (like Mastra or frameworks) to prevent duplicates.

This ensures clean installs, reproducible builds, and avoids subtle dependency issues across workspaces.

## Deployment pitfalls

Common issues to watch for when deploying Mastra in a monorepo:

- **Wrong project root**: make sure the correct package (e.g. `apps/api`) is selected as the deploy target.
- **Output misconfiguration**: verify each package writes compiled files to the expected `dist` or `.build/output` directory.

## Example workflow

A typical deployment process for a Mastra application in a monorepo might look like this:

- **Build all workspaces**: run the root `build` script to compile every package.
- **Select the project root**: choose `apps/api` (or the relevant package) as the deployment target.
- **Configure environment variables**: add required values such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the environment.
- **Deploy**: push the built application to Mastra Cloud or another supported platform.
